       "'This game was terrible. I think they worked too hard on the visuals and didn\\'t do much with the gameplay, which is the most important part. I mean, the visuals look incredible, but is the game really \"fun\"? NO! I mean it\\'s like \"hey let\\'s jump off buildings\" and all I\\'m doing is holding up and A/X. The game play just isn\\'t there, and I don\\'t agree with what Ubisoft did, because they had this hot girl (the producer of the game, Jade Raymond), and they were like \"OK we\\'ve got this hot girl, let\\'s pimp her\" and if you go to gaming websites, you\\'re not gonna see gameplay stuff of Assassin\\'s Creed, you\\'ll see her face with a microphone and it\\'ll be like \"We interviewed Jade Raymond about her favorite cookies!\" It\\'s like man, shut the F*@K UP WHO CARES?! Apparently...a lot of people do, because they bought the game and like it...I mean compare this game with Super Mario Galaxy. A Wii game that really doesn\\'t abuse the Wii Remote, but STILL is very innovative and delivers in the most important part, GAMEPLAY! They were able to do a bit of everything with Mario Galaxy, the graphics were still stunning, the music in the game was orchestrated and sounded amazing, and THAT\\'S a game that deserves game of the year. NOT Assassin\\'s Creed, man, it doesn\\'t even deserve to even be a NOMINEE for Game of the Year. The hype around this game where it was like \"oh it\\'s the next generation of gaming\"....really? I think not! So let me get this straight here, because I think the people liking this game are only liking it because they\\'re Jade fans, so I\\'ll tell you guys, JADE WILL NOT MAKE OUT WITH YOU OR ANYTHING IF YOU LOVE OR DEFEND THIS GAME! If you want a REAL game on the PS3, get Uncharted: Drake\\'s Fortune, if you want a REAL game for the Xbox 360, get Call of Duty 4 (and a ton of other games too), and if you want a REAL game just in all the systems? GET SUPER MARIO GALAXY! I know this comment will be hated by many, but seriously, pressing two buttons for doing all this cool stuff, is that REALLY a fun game? The only reason why other games make it more complicated is because after it\\'ll end up being more innovative and fun. And this game just isn\\'t it.<br /><br />1.3/10 A LIVING HELL!'"

(By the way: The plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if you read this or not anyway)<br /><br />If you are wondering whether to see \"Coyote Ugly\" or not: don\\'t! It\\'s not worth either the money for the ticket or the VHS / DVD. A typical \"Chick-Feel-Good-Flick\", one could say. The plot itself is as shallow as it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American Dream. The young good-looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in New York. The few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail, such as the \"tragic\" accident of the father, the \"difficulties\" of Violet\\'s relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (Director) tries to arouse the audience\\'s pity and sadness put does not have any chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting. Especially Piper Perabo completely fails in convincing one of \"Jersey\\'s\" fear of singing in front of an audience. The only good (and quite funny thing) about \"Coyote Ugly\" is John Goodman, who represents the small ray of hope of this movie.<br /><br />I was very astonished, that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie. First \"Gone In 60 Seconds\" and now this... what happened to great movies like \"The Rock\" and \"Con Air\"? THAT was true Bruckheimer stuff.<br /><br />If you are looking for a superficial movie with good looking women just to have a relaxed evening, you should better go and see \"Charlie\\'s Angels\" (it\\'s much more funny, entertaining and self-ironic) instead of this flick.<br /><br />Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).'"
